### A compilation of code I wrote for my advanced programming class, taken Fall 2025 at ASU from Dr. Chris Plaisier. Assignments demonstrate data handling, data visualization, filtering, and basic statistics. Note: There is no module 2.

# Course learning outcomes
## Students will be able to:

- Develop and run Python code in multiple ways
- Demonstrate proficiency in programming with Python
- Design and compose data structures
- Demonstrate the ability to load and write text files from Python
- Be able to use APIs for Python packages effectively
- Use Pandas to subset, merge, capture, modify data, and deal with missing data
- Make plots describing data and analyses of data
- Apply hypothesis testing statistics to real-world datasets
- Apply both clustering and classification machine learning
- Segment cells and nuclei from microscopy slides
